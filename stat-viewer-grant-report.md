# StatViewer Grant Report #2

This project continues to push updates. There are now downloadable versions of StatViewer on Firefox, Brave, and Google Chrome Browsers.

Most of work with this project was getting Google to agree to put this on the Chrome Store. We wanted the app to be ready for Manifest V2(A Google Chrome Extension update) and thankfully, the submitted code passed and everything should work when the new Chrome Extension rules drop. Many of the issues that came about while working on this project came down to browsers not being compatible or allowing IPFS information to pass in or out of the browser. Super excited to see some of the work from the Browsers and Platforms teams to make this development process easier. 

Working with IPFS in this project consists a ton on CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) and HTTP GET requests. This makes getting data out of the IPFS node into the browser extension for rendering very difficult. In the long term, I and some other contributors are looking at getting a stable desktop app configured. There are UI updates being added this month as well. We got a lot of help from people in the community such as @sgtpookie from the IPFS Desktop team in regards to getting communication between a local IPFS node and our Extension optimized and working better.
