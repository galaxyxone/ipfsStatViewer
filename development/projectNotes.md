# IPFS-Stat-Viewer Project Notes

## User Interface Updates
Going through a bunch of new D3 Information... https://d3js.org/ 
### File_Name Improvements
Right now the filename is within each box within the treemap. The problem is when there are many files or the files are small, then you cannot see the name. Find a better way to handle the way many titles are being viewed at once. Maybe a toggle to turn the titles off too.
- Explore the best ways to show the name of a file within a treemap- look at other software
- Implement UI improvements
- Make the development in this repo easier!

Dynamic Window resizing with D3.js and dynamic popup.html(Chrome) [here](https://observablehq.com/@d3/animated-treemap)

### Firefox Integration

### Chrome Integration
- Fix File Titles Lengths
- (good to have) Toggel the titles
- Update Firefox Extension
## High-Value Information Points
- Looking how to add this into the IPFS Desktop!
## High-Value Information Visualizations
- Look for dope usefull visualizations for local first data
